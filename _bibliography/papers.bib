	abstract = {Developing sensitive and reliable methods to distinguish normal and abnormal brain states is a key neuroscientific challenge. Topological Data Analysis, despite its relative novelty, already generated many promising applications, including in neuroscience. We conjecture its prominent tool of persistent homology may benefit from going beyond analysing structural and functional connectivity to effective connectivity graphs capturing the direct causal interactions or information flows. Therefore, we assess the potential of persistent homology to directed brain network analysis by testing its discriminatory power in two enigmatic examples of disease-related brain connectivity alterations: epilepsy and schizophrenia. We estimate connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiology data, employ Persistent Homology and quantify its ability to distinguish healthy from diseased brain states by applying a support vector machine to features quantifying persistent homology structure.We show how this novel approach compares to classification using standard undirected approaches and original connectivity matrices. In the schizophrenia classification, topological data analysis generally performs close to random, while classifications from raw connectivity perform substantially better; likely due to topographical, rather than topological, specificity of the differences. In seizure discrimination from scalp electroencephalography data, classification based on directed persistent homology features provided comparable results to other methods, reaching 89 percent accuracy. Specific niche for topological data analysis opens when direct comparison of connectivity matrices is unsuitable - such as for intracranial electrophysiology with individual number and location of measurements. While standard homology performed overall better than directed homology, this could be due to notorious technical problems of accurate effective connectivity estimation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
